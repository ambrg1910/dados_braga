3. Send an email to security@example.com with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential solutions you may have identified
   - Your name and contact information (if you wish to be credited)

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Verification**: Our security team will work to verify the issue.
3. **Remediation**: If confirmed, we will develop and test a fix.
4. **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying the Card Operations Insights & Validation System, please follow these security best practices:

### Environment Security

1. **Keep software updated**: Regularly update Node.js, PostgreSQL, and all dependencies.
2. **Use secure connections**: Always use HTTPS in production environments.
3. **Implement proper firewalls**: Restrict access to your database and application servers.
4. **Regular backups**: Maintain regular database backups and test restoration procedures.

### Application Security

1. **Strong authentication**: Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.
2. **Secure JWT**: Use a strong, unique JWT secret and appropriate token expiration times.
3. **Input validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized.
4. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
5. **File upload security**: Validate file types, scan for malware, and store uploaded files securely.

### Database Security

1. **Least privilege principle**: Database users should have only the permissions they need.
2. **Encryption**: Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest.
3. **Connection security**: Use SSL/TLS for database connections.
4. **Regular audits**: Periodically review database access logs and permissions.
